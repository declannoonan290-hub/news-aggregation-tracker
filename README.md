# News Aggregation & Categorization Tracker

## Overview
This project was created to explore how large amounts of news and market-related information can be automatically collected, organized, and presented in a clear, human-readable format.

The focus of this project is information organization, not trading or market prediction. It is designed to reduce information overload by categorizing and prioritizing news based on topic and relevance.

## What I Was Learning
- Collecting data from multiple information sources
- Categorizing and labeling information programmatically
- Designing systems that support human decision-making
- Structuring outputs so information is easier to understand

## Key Features
- Automated collection of news headlines
- Topic-based categorization
- Structured summaries for easier review
- Focus on clarity and usability rather than speed

## Why This Project Matters
This project reflects my interest in how people interact with large amounts of information and how systems can be designed to support learning and understanding. It aligns closely with my interest in training and support roles, where organizing information clearly is essential.
